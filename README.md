<p>Hello, in this project I followed the tutorial similarly NoSQL project. It went very well and for me it was nice to see another way of creating similar things but using other methods.</p>

<p>I feel though that mongoDB method was little bit less complicated to understand and to setup, so I'll most defenetley will use mongoDB. I like the idea of docker and how it works, that it is essentially to create multiple virtual machines on the matter of seconds!</p>

<p>I really enjoyed to learn about all of these things and I will defenetley play around with it more, because this is so wide concept and you can do so many things with it. Other than that I created this function that if you create new object/document it is vissible on the live site aswell as all of the objects/documents that are in one table.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or if you want to see live site just contact me on slack.</p>

<p>I hope that I show everything that was required in skills and knowledge.</p>
